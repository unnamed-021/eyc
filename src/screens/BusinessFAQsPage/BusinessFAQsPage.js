            <BoldText>What exactly is the campaign experience window?</BoldText>

              which EyVocate users can perform all the planned activities for
              your brand experience. It defines the start and end of the active

              a unique URL link is generated for you to share with your
              customers and brand enthusiasts. For public brand experiences, we

              latest experience opportunities via the EyCrowd app notifications,
              directing users with interests aligned to your brand straight to

              Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and TikTok in addition to any web
              URL.

              Clients are issued prorated refunds for any shortfall in

            </BoldText>
            <Text>
              To ensure maximum engagement, we require EyVocates to have public
              social media profiles to join and participate in brand
              experiences.

              What does "time window" mean for a brand experience?
            </BoldText>
            <Text>
              The duration of a brand experience can be adjusted to last
              anywhere from 1 to 7 days to align with your specific campaign
              experience goals. Within this period, known as the campaign
              experience window, EyVocate users will carry out all the
              activities associated with your brand experience.

            </BoldText>
            <Text>
              You can publish a brand experience instantly on our platform.
              However, it's advisable to schedule the start of the brand
              experience a few days post-publication, allowing ample time for
              your dedicated customers and enthusiasts to discover and engage
              with your brand experience.

            <BoldText>
              Is it possible for clients to specify a minimum number of

            </BoldText>
            <Text>
              No, such a requirement is unnecessary with EyCrowd, as our
              emphasis on authenticity means we don't limit participation based
              on follower counts. We value real individuals with a sincere

              your brand's needs. Gather essential feedback and engagement via
